# Manual mapping of PE file
### Not working for most Dlls due to API-MS-Win-Core

This project has the objective to load and map a PE File into memory without using a call to LoadLibraryA from windows API or any other available library.
Development has been stopped.

## Roadmap
- Import from "API-MS-Win-Core" to be fixed
